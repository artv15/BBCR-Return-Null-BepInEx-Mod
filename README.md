# Installation

## Downloading BepInEx binaries
First of all, you need to install BepInEx. To do so, go to [BepInEx 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) release and download BepInEx_x64 *(or BepInEx_x86 if you are running a 32 bit system)*.

## Installing BepInEx
Move the contents of the folder in the game folder (where **BALDI.exe** is located) and **launch the game once** to generate all required folders.

## Downloading the plugin
Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/artv15/BBCR-Return-Null-BepInEx-Mod/releases) and download **BBCR_Return_Null_Mod.dll**.

## Installing the plugin
Move **BBCR_Return_Null_Mod.dll** to **%GameFolder%\BepInEx\plugins**

## All done!
Enjoy!

# To Do:
 - ~~Create an installer (windows is probably going to think that it is a virus)~~
 - ~~Display a successful mod installation (maybe some text in the main menu that mod has been successfully installed)~~
 - ~~Eliminate all checks outside of the main menu (you can still see the glitch on the You Can Think Pad and the endings (secret ones included) are different)~~\
**If you have a suggestion, open an issue!**
