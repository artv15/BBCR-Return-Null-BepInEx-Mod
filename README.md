# Installation

# hey, did you know there is an installer for the mod?
You can download the installer to do the work for you. To do so, just download it from [here](https://github.com/artv15/BBCR-Return-Null-BepInEx-Mod/releases), unpack the archive and launch the .exe file. Antivirus might think that it is a virus, just allow it on the device if it gets triggered. I also recommend to choose the new installer instead of the old one, because it is more easier to use.

## Downloading BepInEx binaries
First of all, you need to install BepInEx. To do so, go to [BepInEx 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) release and download BepInEx_x64 *(or BepInEx_x86 if you are running a 32 bit system)*.

## Installing BepInEx
Move the contents of the folder in the game folder (where **BALDI.exe** is located) and **launch the game once** to generate all required folders.

## Downloading the plugin
Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/artv15/BBCR-Return-Null-BepInEx-Mod/releases) and download **mod.dll**.

## Installing the plugin
Move **mod.dll** to **%GameFolder%\BepInEx\plugins**

# All done!
Enjoy!

**If you have a suggestion, open an issue!**
